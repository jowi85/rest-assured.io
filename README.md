# rest-assured.io

Sample rest-assured.io test methods against a publicly consumable API.  

### To run tests:
1) Create a JUnit run configuration in your IDE (intelliJ, eclipse) and run from there
2) From the command line, navigate to `~/rest-assured.io-sample/` and run `mvn clean test`
    
    * You'll need to add your own api key string to RestAssuredTest.java class
